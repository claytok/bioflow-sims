## üß¨ Part 2: Biological Scenario Analysis (20 points)

### Activity 2.1: Scenario Comparison (10 points)
**For each scenario below, run the simulation for 30 seconds and record your observations:**

| Scenario | Color | Speed (Fast/Medium/Slow) | Biological Context |
|----------|-------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| O‚ÇÇ Diffusion | Red | | Oxygen from blood to tissues |
| Drug Delivery | Purple | | Pharmaceutical drugs to target cells |
| Glucose Transport | Orange | | Glucose from blood to cells |
| Waste Removal | Green | | Metabolic waste from cells to blood |

**Questions:**
1. Which scenario shows the fastest diffusion? Why is this biologically important?
2. Which scenario shows the slowest diffusion? What are the implications for drug delivery?

### Activity 2.2: Real-World Applications (10 points)

- **Question:** Why is rapid oxygen diffusion critical for survival? What happens if diffusion is too slow?

**Option B: Drug Delivery**
- Research: How do pharmaceutical drugs reach their targets?
- Simulation: Use Drug Delivery scenario  
- **Question:** Why are drugs designed to diffuse slowly? What are the trade-offs between fast and slow drug diffusion?

**Option C: Glucose Metabolism**
- Research: How does glucose enter cells for energy production?

### Activity 3.1: Fick's Laws Application (5 points)
1. **Observe the equations section** in the simulation
2. **Fick's First Law:** J = -D √ó ‚àáC
   - **Question:** In the simulation, what represents the concentration gradient (‚àáC)?
   - **Question:** How does the diffusion coefficient (D) vary between scenarios?

3. **Fick's Second Law:** ‚àÇC/‚àÇt = D √ó ‚àá¬≤C

### Activity 3.2: Parameter Calculations (5 points)
**For the O‚ÇÇ Diffusion scenario:**
- Record the displayed values for:
  - Diffusion Coefficient: _____ √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ m¬≤/s
  - Concentration: _____ mM
  - Temperature: _____¬∞C
  - Molecule Size: _____

**Questions:**
1. Calculate the temperature factor: (T + 273.15) / (37 + 273.15)
2. How does this temperature factor affect the effective diffusion coefficient?
3. Why do smaller molecules (like O‚ÇÇ) diffuse faster than larger molecules (like drugs)?

## üéì Part 4: Critical Thinking (5 points)

### Activity 4.1: Design Challenge
**Imagine you're designing a new drug delivery system:**

1. **Requirements:** The drug needs to reach target cells quickly but stay in the bloodstream long enough to be effective.

2. **Design Questions:**
   - What molecular size would you choose for your drug? Why?
   - How would you modify the drug's properties to control its diffusion rate?
   - What other factors (besides diffusion) might affect drug delivery?

3. **Simulation Testing:**
   - Use the Drug Delivery scenario as your baseline
   - **Question:** How would you modify the simulation parameters to test your drug design?

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Take screenshots** of interesting simulation states to include in your report
2. **Record specific observations** - don't just say "it moved faster," describe exactly what you saw
3. **Connect concepts** - relate what you observe in the simulation to real biological processes
4. **Use precise language** - use terms like "concentration gradient," "diffusion coefficient," "molecular size"
5. **Think critically** - don't just describe what happens, explain WHY it happens
